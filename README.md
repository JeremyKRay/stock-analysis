# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to examine Stock Market data, assisting Steve in providing his parents an Excel workbook that will assist them in future ivestments in the stock market. The initial analyses focused on green energy stocks, but the results of which prompted Steve's parents interest in examinining the entire stock market. VBA scripts were created to run the analysis and the concern was that running the macros on larger data sets would prove cumbersome and slow. Then final workbook contains a script that can run the same analysis but on a much larger data set that includes all stocks and it can produce results with much better performance. This is determined by running a run time performance script.
## Results
The original VBA script took roughly 1.3 seconds to run for both the 2017 and 2018 results. This would increase significantly as the data set increases in size. The refactored version created an index and additional arrays that speeds up the process of looping through the data and retrieving values. Please follow the links to view the 2 pop up windows that are currently produced showing the time it takes to run the script. You will see the performance has increased significantly. ![Please Follow link](https://github.com/JeremyKRay/stock-analysis/blob/3783d18d1476a9d0018a6f64645fbae7f07d30e8/VBA_Challenge_2017.png).![Please Follow link](https://github.com/JeremyKRay/stock-analysis/blob/2aa53730b41907122c651e97cac1a8da00d1cc93/VBA_Challenge_2018.png). 
## Summary 
The most obvious advantage to refactoring code is increasing performance. The code runs much faster and cleaner with the refactored code. The code however is a bit more complex and requires a higher level of coding expertise, which could be considered a disadvantage. 

This was evident when working with the original code and our new refactored code. The advantage being that the refactored code runs roughly 6 times faster than the original code. The disadvantage is that the refactored code proved more difficult for me to write; it was easy to break and/or have it produce incorrect results. In the end, however, it is evident that refactoring code is a good practice. Code should be able to perform well no matter the data set size.
