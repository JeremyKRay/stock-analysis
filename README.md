# Stock Analysis
An analysis of green energy stocks for Steve to better advise his parents
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to provide steve a workbook to provide his parents to allow them to easily analyze stocks. We had previously provided a workbook that sufficed, but we revisited the code to refactor it so that it runs more efficiently. This way his parents can expand their analysis to examine the entire stock market and performance of the tools will remain optimal.
