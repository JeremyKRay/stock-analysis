# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to examine Stock Market data, assisting Steve in providing his parents an Excel workbook that will assist them in future ivestments in the stock market. The initial analyses focused on green energy stocks, but the results of which prompted Steve's parents interest in examinining the entire stock market. VBA scripts were created to run the analysis and the concern was that running the macros on larger data sets would prove cumbersome and slow. Then final workbook contains a script that can run the same analysis but on a much larger data set that includes all stocks and it can produce results with much better performance. This is determined by running a run time performance script.
## Results
The original VBA script took roughly 1.3 seconds to run for both the 2017 and 2018 results. The refactored version created an index and additional arrays that speeds up the process of looping through the data and retrieving values. Please follow the links to view the 2 pop up windows that are currently produced showing the time it takes to run the script. You will see the performance has increased significantly. ![Please Follow link](https://github.com/JeremyKRay/stock-analysis/blob/3783d18d1476a9d0018a6f64645fbae7f07d30e8/VBA_Challenge_2017.png).
